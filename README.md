# FlappyBirdGame
Flappy Bird is a popular 2D side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird, guiding it through a series of obstacles by tapping the screen or pressing a key to make the bird flap its wings and ascend. The goal is to navigate the bird through openings between pipes without colliding with them. With each successful passage, the player earns points, and the game becomes progressively more challenging as the speed increases.
